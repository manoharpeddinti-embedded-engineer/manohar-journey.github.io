# 🚀 Phase 4: The Breakthrough — Internship at Microchip

> *“You never forget the first time you walk into a company you once googled.”*

### 🎒 The First Step Into Industry

After that unbelievable placement moment, it was time to pack my bags again —  
this time not for another campus, but for the **real world**.  

Walking into the **Microchip office** for the first time was surreal.  
For a second, I just stood at the gate staring at the logo thinking,  
> “This is the same company whose datasheets I used in college!”  

From that moment, I knew this wasn’t going to be a typical internship — it was going to be *the* turning point.

### 🧠 The Early Days — From Theory to Reality

The first few weeks were pure learning mode.  
No one was spoon-feeding anything.  
They handed me a dev board and said,  
> “Here’s the hardware. Boot Linux. Let’s see what you can do.”  

I still remember that first boot log — hundreds of lines scrolling, half of them errors. 😅  
Every single day was a new puzzle:  
kernel panic, driver mismatch, SD card not mounting, display not initializing.  

But weirdly, I loved it.  
For the first time, **textbooks became real** —  
I could actually see how the bootloader, kernel, and file system all came together.


the work is very similar to my Robotics lab work, i treated this also as another Lab.

### 🔍 Debugging Diaries

Most interns fear breaking things.  
I broke them daily. 😂  

Once, I edited a device tree file trying to enable an LED pin, and the whole system refused to boot.  
It was scary at first, but my mentor just smiled and said,  
> “Good. Now you’ll really learn.”  

That’s when I learned the golden rule of embedded systems:  
> “You only understand a bug when you’ve created one yourself.” 🧩  

I used to stay late sometimes, trying to trace issues line by line,  
and the feeling of finally seeing **“Boot successful”** on UART after two days of pain?  
Pure dopamine. ⚡

### 🤖 The Face Detection Demo

A few months in, my mentor asked,  
> “Want to try something cool with AI?”  

That’s how I got into one of the most exciting projects —  
a **face detection demo** using **TensorFlow Lite** on the **SAMA5D27 board**.  

I still remember the setup:  
a USB camera, a small LCD, and a demo that would freeze the screen  
if more than one face appeared — to simulate security monitoring.  

At first, it lagged so badly we thought the board would take early retirement. 😅  
But after days of optimization — playing with inference times,  
tweaking Python code, and even trimming the model —  
the demo worked beautifully.  

When it finally ran smoothly, everyone in the lab turned to look at the screen.  
That small moment — a blinking green box around my face —  
felt like a medal of honor. 🏅

### 🧰 Beyond Coding — The Team That Made It Fun

The best part about Microchip was the **people**.  
My mentors never made me feel like “just an intern.”  
They’d guide, challenge, and sometimes roast me for printing debug logs in loops. 😂  


Those moments taught me something no lecture ever could —  
**real engineering is teamwork, patience, and a sense of humor.**

### 🧰 My Internship Project — The Robot That Changed Everything

Yes, you guessed it right — my **internship project was a robot**. 🤖  
Robots have been a part of my story since college,  
but this time it wasn’t a small line follower made from spare parts and hot glue.  
This one ran on a **real MPU**, controlled by **Linux**, talking to sensors, motors,  
and peripherals like a professional system.  

When I first heard about the project, I smiled to myself and thought,  
> “Of course it had to be a robot. Some habits never die.”  

The goal was simple on paper — build a multipurpose robot platform  
that could demonstrate the power of Microchip’s embedded processors.  
In reality? It was weeks of sleepless nights, wiring chaos, and debugging loops.  

Every single subsystem had its own personality:  
- The **motor controller** had mood swings.  
- The **sensors** behaved like introverts — worked only when no one watched.  
- And the **camera module**? It refused to cooperate unless you rebooted twice. 😅  

But slowly, piece by piece, everything started coming together.  
I worked on GPIOs, PWM control, and communication between the processor and motors,  
and then moved to integrating a **graphical interface** that displayed robot status in real time.  

After months of tinkering, coding, and re-soldering,  
the robot finally came alive — moving gracefully, responding to commands,  
and running AI models that detected faces and obstacles.  
It wasn’t just a project anymore — it felt like watching a part of myself come to life again. ❤️  

The demo became an instant hit inside the company.  
Managers, engineers, and even visiting clients stopped by to see “that intern’s robot.”  
It started as a small side project but ended up being showcased  
as a **flagship demo** for Microchip’s MPU capabilities.  

That recognition meant a lot.  
All the late nights, the debugging battles, the caffeine, the code rewrites — totally worth it.  

> “The same kid who once climbed a gate to fix a robot was now building one that made a company proud.”  

None of it would’ve been possible without the incredible guidance of my **manager** and **team lead**.  
They gave me the freedom to experiment, the patience when I failed,  
and the motivation to keep pushing when things got tough. 🙏  

That robot didn’t just move —  
it moved my career forward. 🚀

Thanks to my manager and team lead for the support.

### ⚙️ What I Learned

- 🧩 **Debugging is an art.** The system always knows more than you — you just have to listen carefully.  
- 💻 **Hardware and software aren’t separate.** They’re two halves of the same heartbeat.  
- 🕒 **Persistence pays off.** Every “why is this not working?” takes you one step closer to “finally, it works.”  
- 🤝 **Mentorship matters.** The right mentor can turn panic into progress.

### 🌟 The Turning Moment

During my day as an intern, HR said,  
> “You’ve done solid work. Let’s continue this full-time.”  

That line hit differently.  
From being the kid who once climbed a college gate to get a mat,  
to now being offered a **career at Microchip** —  
it felt like life had come full circle.  

I didn’t celebrate with a party.  
I just smiled, packed my board, and whispered to myself,  
> “Okay, next challenge.” 💪

### 💬 Takeaway

That internship wasn’t just an entry into industry —  
it was the moment I stopped feeling like a student  
and started seeing myself as an **engineer**.  

> “You don’t need to be the smartest in the room.  
> You just need to stay curious long enough to figure things out.” 🔧
