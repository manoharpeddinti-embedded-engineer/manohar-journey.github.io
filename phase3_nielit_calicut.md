# 🌄 Phase 3: The Foundation — M.Tech at NIELIT Calicut

> *“Sometimes the right place finds you, not the other way around.”*

### 🚉 The Arrival

It was **5:30 a.m.**, the air was chilly and filled with fog when I first stepped into **NIELIT Calicut**.  
The campus looked like something straight out of a movie — endless greenery, hills in the backdrop, and silence broken only by birds. 🐦  

I still remember dragging my suitcase through the misty path toward the hostel.  
Every step I took, I kept thinking:  
> “This is it. I’m here to work hard and make it big — Intel, AMD, something great.”  

That first walk itself felt like a promise to myself.

### 🏞️ The Campus That Heals and Teaches

NIELIT wasn’t just a college — it was an *experience*.  

From the main gate to the hostel was almost a morning trek. On both sides: **trees, wildflowers, and sometimes even peacocks** strolling like they owned the place. 🦚  
Every once in a while, a snake would remind us we were living in the middle of real nature. 🐍  

The hostel was huge — open grounds, **badminton court**, **volleyball court**, and the kind of peace that made you forget city noise.  
We’d often spend evenings playing, laughing, and then heading to the canteen for a cup of Kerala chai. ☕

### 📚 The Learning Curve

Classes started soon — and man, were they intense!  
No spoon-feeding here. The professors made sure we actually *understood* what we were doing.  

That’s where I first touched **real embedded Linux** —  
bootloaders, kernel compilation, **Buildroot**, **Yocto**, and the magic of seeing your custom Linux image boot on hardware for the first time. 💻✨  

At first, it was overwhelming. Commands failed, builds crashed, SD cards got corrupted — but every failure was a new lesson.  
I slowly realized this was the phase that would **build my foundation as an engineer**.

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Hostel Life — Where Memories Were Made

Hostel life at NIELIT was something else.  
You meet strangers who quickly turn into family.  

We had group study sessions that started seriously and always ended with jokes.  
Late-night Maggi runs 🍜, discussions about who would crack which company, and that one friend who always overslept for lab — every moment was gold.  

Some nights, we’d sit under the stars outside the hostel, talking about dreams —  
> “Bro, one day we’ll work at Qualcomm or Intel.”  
Back then, it sounded far-fetched. But we meant it.

### ⚡ The Turning Point — The Microchip Story

Then came the placement season — and with it, **Microchip Technology**.  
I was so excited to apply; I believed this was *the* opportunity.  

I wrote the **online test**, waited for results… and then saw the list.  
My name wasn’t there.  
That silence hit hard. I still remember staring at the notice board thinking,  
> “Maybe next time.”  

A few days later, another list came out — a **second-round shortlist** for interviews.  
And there it was.  
My name.  

I had mixed feelings — shocked, thrilled, nervous — all at once. 😅  
Some of my batchmates got called for the second round,  
but I was in the **first-round batch**, and after **just one round of interview**, I got through.  

The next day, they announced the results:  
Only **four students** were shortlisted for the next level in **Chennai**.  

And guess what? I was one of them. 🙌

### ✈️ The Chennai Chapter

We reached Chennai for the final interviews.  
Right before entering the panel room, HR told us,  
> “We’ll select only three of you.” 😳  

That line hit us like a lightning bolt.  
It was both motivation and pressure in one sentence.  

Inside, I gave it everything.  
I spoke about my **Linux builds, bootloader work**, and how we debugged embedded issues from scratch at NIELIT.  
They nodded, smiled, and asked,  
> “So, if we give you real customer issues tomorrow, can you handle them?”  
I said,  
> “I’ve been handling them since my first SD card got corrupted, sir.”  

Everyone laughed — and that laughter broke the tension.  

When results came, I was one of the three selected.  
That moment felt unreal. From being **rejected in the first list** to **clearing in one interview round** —  
it felt like destiny saying, *“You earned this.”*

### 🧠 The Lessons I Took Home

NIELIT taught me more than any textbook ever could.  

- 🌿 **Patience** — things take time; even a kernel needs to build before it boots.  
- ⚙️ **Consistency** — one day of focus beats weeks of procrastination.  
- 🧩 **Teamwork** — no one cracks debugging alone at 2 a.m.  
- ❤️ **Gratitude** — for the people, the professors, and those endless nights of learning.

### 🎯 Looking Back

Whenever I think of those foggy mornings, the laughter echoing in the hostel corridors, or the adrenaline of that **Microchip selection**, it reminds me of one truth:

> “You don’t grow when things are easy.  
> You grow when you walk miles through the fog —  
> trusting that every step is taking you somewhere meaningful.” 🌫️  

That’s what **NIELIT Calicut** gave me —  
**clarity in the middle of confusion, confidence in the middle of chaos.**

### 💬 Takeaway

If you ever find yourself in a place far from home, unsure where it might lead — don’t worry.  
Sometimes, that’s exactly where your story begins.  

I went there as a student.  
I came back as an engineer. 💪
