Phase 1: The Beginning — Life in a Tier-3 College

“Sometimes, the place you least wanted to go becomes the place that builds you.”

Back in 2016, I had one dream — to crack JEE and get into an IIT. Like every other engineering aspirant, I believed that was the path to success. But life had other plans. After the results, I didn’t see my name anywhere near the cutoff list. I remember sitting with that hollow feeling, thinking, “So now what?”

So I packed my hopes, gave the state entrance exam, and landed in a Tier-3 college in Hyderabad. It wasn’t the dream, but it was the start.

The Commute Chronicles

My college was far — really far. Every morning, I’d leave home at 6:30 a.m., catch a city bus just to reach the college bus stop, and then hop onto the actual college bus. I was literally the first guy on that route every single day.
The bus driver knew my name better than some professors.

By 9:10, I’d reach college, grab a tea from the tiny stall near the gate, and just watch the sleepy campus come alive. Classes started at 9:30, but I was already there—half-awake, half-motivated, and fully hungry.

Reality Check

The first few weeks felt strange. Everyone around me was talking about placements in software companies.
Core electronics? Hardly anyone cared.
That’s when it hit me — if I wanted to make something out of this, I couldn’t just follow the crowd. I had to find my own path.
Slowly, professors started noticing my interest. One even said, “You’ll end up doing something different, I can see it.”
At that time, I had no idea how true that would become.

Friends, Fun & First Lessons

College wasn’t all serious, of course. We had our fair share of bunked classes, canteen chai breaks that lasted an hour, and those last-minute lab submissions where the resistor values never matched.
But those moments built friendships that made every 6 a.m. bus ride worth it.

And somewhere between those classes, jokes, and power-cuts-during-lab moments, a spark started forming — the feeling that maybe, just maybe, I could build things that mattered.

The Turning Whisper

Then came the day that changed everything.
One of our professors stopped us after class and said,

“You guys seem curious. How about trying something different? There’s a robotics competition coming up.”

That single line lit something inside me.
I didn’t know it yet, but that conversation was the door to everything that followed — competitions, prototypes, sleepless nights, and a career that would take me places I’d only dreamed of.

Takeaway

If you’re reading this from a small college, thinking your opportunities are limited — trust me, they’re not.
I didn’t have a fancy lab or a big brand name.
What I had was a bus pass, a stubborn mind, and a few friends crazy enough to dream with me.

That’s all you need to start.
