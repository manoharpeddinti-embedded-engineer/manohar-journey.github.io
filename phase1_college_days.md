# 🌱 Phase 1: The Beginning — Life in a Tier-3 College

> *“Sometimes, the place you least wanted to go becomes the place that builds you.”*

### 🎯 The Start of the Journey

Back in **2016**, I had one dream — to crack **JEE** and get into an **IIT**.  
Like every other engineering aspirant, I believed that was *the* path to success.  

But life had other plans. After the results, my name was nowhere near the cutoff list.  
That sinking feeling hit hard.  
> “So… now what?”  

I took the state-level exam and landed in a **Tier-3 college in Hyderabad**.  
Not the dream. But the beginning.

### 🚌 The Commute Chronicles

My college was *far* — really far.  
Every morning I left home at **6:30 a.m.**, caught a public bus just to reach the **college bus stop**,  
and then took another bus to the actual campus.  

I was literally the **first person on that route** every single day.  
The bus driver knew my name better than some professors. 😅  

By **9:10 a.m.**, I’d reach college, grab tea from the small stall near the gate,  
and watch the sleepy campus come alive.  
Classes started at **9:30**, but I was already there — half-awake, half-motivated, fully hungry. 🍵

### 💭 Reality Check

The first few weeks felt strange. Everyone talked about **software jobs** and **IT placements**.  
Core electronics? Almost nobody cared.  

That’s when I realized — if I wanted to make something out of this,  
I couldn’t follow the crowd. I had to find *my own path*.   


Slowly, professors noticed my curiosity. One even said,  
> “You’ll end up doing something different — I can see it.”  

At that time, I had no idea how true that would be.

### 🤝 Friends, Fun & First Lessons

College wasn’t all serious. We had our fair share of **bunked classes**,  
**canteen chai breaks**, and those **last-minute lab submissions**  
where resistor values never matched.  

But those moments built friendships that made every 6 a.m. bus ride worth it. ❤️  

Somewhere between the jokes, mini-projects, and power-cuts-during-lab moments,  
a spark started forming —  
the feeling that maybe, just maybe, I could *build* things that mattered.

### ⚡ The Turning Whisper

Then came the day that changed everything.  
One of our professors stopped us after class and said,  

> “You guys seem curious. How about trying something different?  
> There’s a **robotics competition** coming up.” 🤖  

That single line lit something inside me.  
I didn’t know it yet, but that conversation would open the door  
to everything that followed — competitions, prototypes, sleepless nights,  
and a journey that would change how I saw engineering forever.

### 💬 Takeaway

If you’re from a **small college**, wondering if your opportunities are limited — trust me, they’re not.  

I didn’t have a fancy lab or a big brand name.  
What I had was a **bus pass**, a **stubborn mind**, and a few **friends crazy enough to dream** with me. 🚍💡  

That’s all you need to start. 🌟
