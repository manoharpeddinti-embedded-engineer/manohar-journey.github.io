Phase 2: The Spark — Robotics Club & Industrial Exposure

“It all started with one professor, one challenge, and zero idea of what we were doing.”

So there we were — four students in our second year, half-asleep after class, when our strict professor called us to his cabin.
We thought we were in trouble. You know that heart-drop moment when a lecturer says, “Come see me after class”? Yeah, that.

But instead, he looked up and said,

“There’s a robotics competition coming up at BITS Hyderabad. You boys up for it?”

We said yes immediately — no second thought, no plan, no clue.
And that “yes” changed everything.

The First Robot — and a Lesson in Humility

We had no experience. No seniors guiding us. No fancy lab. Just an Arduino board, a bunch of wires, two motors, and unlimited YouTube confidence.
We started working during the Dussehra holidays. While everyone else went home, we were in the lab — day and night.

We wanted to build a line follower robot.
The first time we powered it on, it didn’t follow any line. It spun in circles like a confused puppy.
We laughed, fixed wires, swapped sensors, and by midnight, it sort of started moving straight.
Progress.

At My Friend’s Home — The Pre-Midnight Hustle

We decided to take all our parts to my friend’s home to continue testing overnight.
We barely slept — maybe two hours at most. At 3 a.m., while running a few final tests, we realized something terrifying:

The testing mat — the black-and-white track — was locked inside the college lab.

Everything we worked for depended on that mat. And our college was closed.

The Gate-Climbing Mission

We reached college at around 3:30 a.m.
The entire campus was dark — not a single light in sight.
We shouted for the watchman, no response. My friend, being the practical one, said, “Bro, let’s just go back.”
I said, “If we go back now, all our hard work means nothing. I’ll climb.”

He looked at me and said, “Bro, if you fall, I’m not jumping in to save you. I’ll just call for help.”
Fair deal.

So, I climbed the tall gate, phone torch in one hand, adrenaline in the other.
The sound of my shoes hitting the metal echoed like a horror movie.
Once inside, I tiptoed through the corridor, searching for the watchman. No luck.

That’s when I saw the newly renovated admin block.
I don’t know what possessed me, but I walked toward it.
Halfway through, my friend called — “Bro, where are you?”
The call disconnected. The signal was gone. The silence was louder than anything I’d ever heard.

I swear, for a moment, I felt like someone was walking behind me.
I turned — nothing.
I grabbed the key I’d seen earlier, opened the lab, found the mat, and when I bent down to fold it —
BANG! A drawer slid open by itself.

I didn’t stop to investigate. I grabbed the mat, sprinted like a madman, and leaped back over the gate.
My friend was laughing, saying, “You saw a ghost?”
I said, “No idea, but I definitely outran one.”

The Dual-Side Gate Experiment

By then, it was around 4 a.m. The sky was still dark.
We didn’t have permission to enter the campus, so we set up right outside the main gate.
My friend sat on one side — near the streetlight, with the laptop.
I sat on the other side — inside the gate, holding the robot and the track mat.

The cable wasn’t long enough to reach both sides, so we literally passed the USB wire through the gate grills.
He’d sit there writing code, hit upload, and shout, “Done!”
I’d grab the robot, place it on the mat, and yell back, “Running… it’s running straight… oh wait—it stopped again!”

We were basically running an international border operation — one coder, one tester, one gate in between.

And right when it started working perfectly, the watchman woke up.
He thought we were thieves.
After a solid five minutes of scolding, he ended up standing next to us, watching our robot run circles.
Even he couldn’t stop smiling.

The Competition Day

We finally made it to BITS Hyderabad.
There were teams from IITs and NITs with robots that looked like they came straight out of NASA labs.
Ours looked like something that had survived a war — taped wires, crooked wheels, and lots of spirit.

During the final run, one small wire slipped, and the robot stopped halfway.
We lost.

But honestly? It didn’t matter.
Because that night — climbing gates, chasing ghosts, testing through a college fence — had already taught us what real engineering felt like.

The Aftermath — Birth of the Club

We came back with lessons instead of trophies.
We fixed the mistakes, rebuilt the robot, and joined more competitions.
Soon, we formed our own Robotics Club — pulling in juniors, getting permissions for late-night labs, and turning our failures into training sessions.

Within a year, our line follower robot became unbeatable.
We started winning.
Our college name — the same Tier-3 tag people once laughed at — started being announced at IITs and NITs.
That feeling? Pure gold.

Lessons from the Gate and the Ghost

Engineering isn’t just theory; it’s passion + panic at 3 a.m.

Sometimes you don’t need fancy labs — just crazy friends and a half-working Arduino.

Losing once doesn’t mean failing. It means you’re one debug away from success.

And if a drawer opens by itself at 3 a.m.? Don’t look back. Just grab the mat and run.

That robotics phase didn’t just teach me robotics — it taught me courage, creativity, and pure persistence.
From that day, I stopped waiting for opportunities.
I learned to build them — even if it meant climbing a gate in the middle of the night.
