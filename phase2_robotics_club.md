🌟 Phase 2: The Spark — Robotics Club & Industrial Exposure

“It all started with one professor, one challenge, and zero idea of what we were doing.”

🎓 The Unexpected Beginning

So there we were — four students in our second year, half-asleep after class, when our strict professor called us to his cabin.
We thought we were in trouble. You know that heart-drop moment when a lecturer says —

“Come see me after class.” 😬

But instead, he looked up and said:

“There’s a robotics competition coming up at BITS Hyderabad. You boys up for it?”

Without thinking twice, we said yes! — no plan, no clue, no idea what we just signed up for.
And that yes changed everything.

⚙️ The First Robot — and a Lesson in Humility

We had zero experience. No seniors, no mentors, no fancy lab — just one Arduino board, a couple of motors, and unlimited YouTube confidence.

We spent our Dussehra holidays locked in the lab while everyone else went home.
Our mission: build a line follower robot.

Our result:

A robot that didn’t follow any line — it just spun in circles like a confused puppy. 🐶

We laughed, re-soldered, swapped sensors, and by midnight, it sort of moved in a straight line.
That tiny progress felt like we’d invented AI.

🏠 At My Friend’s Home — The Pre-Midnight Hustle

We shifted all our parts to my friend’s home to continue testing overnight.
Sleep? Maybe 2 hours max. Coffee? Unlimited.

At 3 a.m., while testing, we realized the worst possible thing:

The testing mat — the black-and-white track — was locked inside our college lab.

Our robot was ready. The mat wasn’t.
And the college was closed.

🧗 The Gate-Climbing Mission

We reached college around 3:30 a.m.
Pitch dark. No lights. No watchman in sight.

My friend whispered,

“Bro, let’s just go home.”
I said,
“If we go now, everything we built goes to waste. I’ll climb.”

He looked at me and said,

“If you fall, I’m not jumping in. I’ll call for help.” 😅

Fair deal.

So I climbed the tall iron gate — phone torch in one hand, adrenaline in the other.
Every sound echoed like a horror movie scene.

Once inside, I searched for the watchman — nothing.
Then I saw the newly renovated admin block. Don’t ask why, but I walked straight into it.
Halfway through, my friend called:

“Bro, where are you?”
The call disconnected.

The silence was deafening. I swear I heard footsteps behind me. I turned — nothing.
I found the lab keys, opened the door, spotted the mat, bent to pick it up —
and BANG! — a drawer slid open by itself.

Let’s just say… I didn’t wait to investigate.
I grabbed the mat, sprinted like Usain Bolt, and leapt over that gate again.

My friend was laughing hysterically.

“You saw a ghost?”
“No idea, bro. But I definitely outran one.” 👻

⚡ The Dual-Side Gate Experiment

By 4 a.m., the sky was still dark.
We couldn’t go inside the campus, so we set up right at the main gate.

My friend sat outside near the streetlight with his laptop. 💻

I sat inside with the robot and the mat. 🤖

The USB cable was short, so we literally passed it through the gate grills.
It looked like a cross-border tech operation.

Him: “Done uploading!”
Me: “Running... running... wait—stopped again!”

We debugged, re-uploaded, tested, and failed — until it finally worked.
That tiny robot followed the line perfectly.
We screamed with joy like kids who’d just won the World Cup.

Even the watchman, who woke up mid-testing, came and watched.
After five minutes of scolding, he ended up saying,

“Nice work, beta. Don’t burn anything.”

🏁 The Competition Day

We reached BITS Hyderabad, proudly carrying our battle-scarred robot.
There were teams from IITs and NITs with shiny robots that looked like they belonged in a NASA lab.
Ours looked like it had barely survived an explosion.

And yet… it worked.
Until the final round — one loose wire, one small short, and the robot stopped halfway.

We didn’t win a trophy.
But we won something bigger — confidence. 💪

That night of climbing gates, chasing ghosts, and coding through college fences had already made us engineers in spirit.

🧠 The Aftermath — Birth of the Robotics Club

We came back, rebuilt the robot, and joined more competitions.
We pulled juniors in, got permissions for late-night lab access, and slowly built something real —
a Robotics Club in our small Tier-3 college.

Within a year, our line follower robot became unbeatable.
We started winning.
And that same college name that once made people laugh started echoing in IITs and NITs.
That feeling? Pure gold. 🏆

💡 Lessons from the Gate and the Ghost

🧩 Engineering isn’t theory — it’s passion + panic at 3 a.m.

💻 You don’t need fancy labs — just crazy friends and a half-working Arduino.

⚡ Losing once doesn’t mean failing — you’re just one debug away from success.

👻 And if a drawer opens by itself at 3 a.m.? Don’t look back — grab the mat and run.

That robotics phase didn’t just teach me circuits or code — it taught me courage, creativity, and pure persistence.
From that night on, I stopped waiting for opportunities.
I started building them — even if it meant climbing a gate in the middle of the night.
